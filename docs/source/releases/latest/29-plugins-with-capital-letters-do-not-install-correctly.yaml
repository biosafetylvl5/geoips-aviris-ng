bug fix:
- description: |
    Added a line to pyproject.toml that allows plugins with names with uppercase
    letters to be installed correctly. This avoids a somewhat unhelpful error
    message produced by pip install. Note that existing plugins with
    lowercase-only names still install correctly.
